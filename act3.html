	<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Let the people know you as a person and as an individual to society?</b>
		<br><br>
		Hi everyone, my name is Christian Joseph R. Agopitac but you can call me Cj. I like arts, and I mostly do music. I rarely go outside and I'm an introverted guy who spends a lot of time at home playing instruments, especially the guitar.
		<br><br>
		<b>What is your Guiding Principle in living your life and why is that so?</b>
		My guiding principle is "Slow and Steady Wins the Race." I'd rather be slow than be fast but not exactly know what I'm doing. Being slow means being certain and optimistic about the future.
		<br><br>
		<b>How are you alike and different from others?</b>
		<br><br>
		I'm eccentric and the odd one out in my group of friends. I don't go to parties, and I'm that guy who eats and leaves unnoticed because I don't like staying for long.
		<br><br>
		<b>Enumerate your accomplishments, no matter how little or unimportant they may seem, that you and your family are proud of.</b>
		<br><br>
		For me, one of my accomplishments was performing a gig in a mall with a big audience. It made my music spirit immensely happy. Graduating from senior high school also made me and my parents proud. Lastly, surviving the first semester of college is something to be proud of.
		<br><br>
		<b>What are your dreams and future plans?</b>
		<br><br>
		My dreams and plans are simple. I want to finish college so that I can repay all the hard work and sacrifices my parents have made for me. It might be a long and slow journey, but I want to take it slow and steady to secure our future.
